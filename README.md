Assignment
You will be building a simple command line Hangman game where one player plays against the computer, but a bit more advanced.

When a new game is started, your script should load in the dictionary and randomly select a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word.

Every turn, allow the player to make a guess of a letter. It should be case insensitive. Update the display to reflect whether the letter was correct or incorrect. If out of guesses, the player should lose.

Now implement the functionality where, at the start of any turn, instead of making a guess the player should also have the option to save the game.

When the program first loads, add in an option that allows you to open one of your saved games, which should jump you exactly back to where you were when you saved.
